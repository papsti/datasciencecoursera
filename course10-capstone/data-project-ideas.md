# Ideas for data projects

* analysis of goodreads data (https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k)
  * can we predict book rating based on analysis of synopsis (key words)?
  * can we predict rating based on content of review text?
  * basic anaylsis of which books rate well (using genre, length, etc. as features)
